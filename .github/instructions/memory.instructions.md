# Project Context & Memory

- There is a GitHub Action (`.github/workflows/release.yml`) that automatically creates a release when a tag starting with `v*` is pushed.
- Memory: Always rely on the GitHub Action to build and release when a tag is pushed.
- Memory: If XAML errors occur, I cannot see them and must ask the user for the error details.
