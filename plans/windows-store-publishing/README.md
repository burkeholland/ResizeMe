# PR 1.0: Windows App Store Publishing Preparation

**Branch:** `feature/windows-store-publishing`
**Steps:** 3 steps (COMPLEX)

## Overview

This plan prepares ResizeMe for Windows Store publishing by focusing on technical prerequisites:

1. **Developer Account Setup** - Microsoft Partner Center registration and verification
2. **Package Configuration** - Store-compatible MSIX packaging setup 
3. **Build Validation** - Ensure release builds meet store requirements

Marketing materials (app name, screenshots, descriptions) will be configured directly in Partner Center during the actual publish phase.

## Folder Structure

Each step has a corresponding folder with detailed implementation guides:
- `1-developer-account-setup/` — Partner Center account creation and setup
- `2-store-package-config/` — MSIX packaging and manifest configuration
- `3-build-validation/` — Build process validation and documentation

Follow the master `plan.md` for step sequence, then work through each step's implementation folder.

After completion, the app will be ready for name reservation and submission in Partner Center.
