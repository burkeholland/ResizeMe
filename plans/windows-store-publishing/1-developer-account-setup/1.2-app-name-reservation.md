```xml

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Solution |
|-------|----------|
| Desired app name unavailable | Try variations or choose alternative; name must be unique globally |
| Publisher identity not visible | Check Account Settings → Publisher Profile; may need to complete verification |
| Package identity not generated | Complete app name reservation first; identity generates automatically |
| Cannot create new app | Verify developer account is fully approved and in good standing |

## Files Modified

- [ ] ✅ **Created**: Documentation of store identity information (save in secure location)

## Store Identity Information Template

Create a secure text file with this information for Step 2:

```text
=== RESIZEME STORE IDENTITY ===
Date Created: [Current Date]
Partner Center Account: [Your Microsoft Account]

App Information:

- Package Family Name: [Generated]
- Package Identity Name: [Generated]

Publisher Information:
- Publisher Display Name: [From Partner Center]
- Publisher ID: [From Partner Center]
- Certificate Subject: [Generated CN= string]

Next Steps:
- Use Package Identity Name for Package.appxmanifest Name attribute
- Use Certificate Subject for Package.appxmanifest Publisher attribute
- Configure these values in Step 2.1
```

## What Comes Next

- Next substep: Step 2.1 - Package Manifest Store Configuration
- The reserved app name and identity will be used in package manifest

- **Package identity values are permanent** once first package is uploaded
- **Publisher certificate subject** must match exactly in manifest for store acceptance
- **Save identity information securely** - needed for all future updates
